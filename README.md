# Project HANGMANGAME

The best beginner project we can consider is the game of Hangman. I am sure the majority of you reading this Python Projects blog has played Hangman at one point of time in your life. To put it in just one single statement, the main goal here is to create a “guess the word” game. As simple as it sounds, it has certain key things you need to note. 

The user needs to be able to input letter guesses.
A limit should also be set on how many guesses they can use.
Keep notifying the user of the remaining turns.
This means you’ll need a way to grab a word to use for guessing. Let us keep it simple and use a text file for the input. The text file consits of the words from which we have to guess.

You will also need functions to check if the user has actually inputted a single letter, to check if the inputted letter is in the hidden word (and if it is, how many times it appears), to print letters, and a counter variable to limit guesses.

Key Concepts to keep in mind for this Python Project:

* Random
* Variables
* Boolean
* Input and Output
* Integer
* Char
* String
* Length
* Print
